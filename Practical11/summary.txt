/Findings/
human_mouse: alignment score is 1091.0, percentage of the identical amino acids is 89.64%
human_random: alignment score is -55.5, percentage of the identical amino acids is 5.41%
mouse_random: alignment score is -44.5, percentage of the identical amino acids is 5.86%

/Interpretation/
The score of human_mouse sequence comparison is large, and the score of human/mouse_random sequence comparison is small.
This indicates that human and mouse sequence are highly relative, while they have rare relationship with random sequence, which is reasonable.
Thus, huamn and mouse are highly homologous. They may descend from a branch of common ancestor.

The percentage of identical amino acids is high in human_mouse comparison, while it is low in human/mouse_random, which is reasonable.
This means that mouse sequence and human sequence are 89.64% similar.
