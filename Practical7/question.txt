Questions: How the trend of Chinese covid patients number correlates with cases numbers of the whole world 
Line number:69
Result: The plot shows that in Januanry and February, the world cases are almost equal to the Chinese cases, and both trends increase rapidly at first and then turn mildly; after February, the Chinese total cases almost stay constant while the world cases increase in an expotential growth.
These results mean that though Chinese cases are in high proportion of the world cases in the first two months, China controled the pandemic and the Chinese cases went down. However, Covid went popular after Februray in other countries and were not controled, so the world total cases constantly growed.
